				How do you identify?

			<p>
				Perfume comes in crystal bottles. Fact? Well, only partly. Personal perfume comes in crystal bottles. Tiny and elaborate, they are the modern expression of an ancient craft and precious resource that remain very relevant to life today. Perfume has become an intrinsic part of our lives; it may wake us up, sooth and comfort us. It is a part of our identity.

						The term olfaction refers to the human sense of smell. Like many bodily functions, olfaction occurs involuntarily most of the time. Though you may not realize it consciously, every breath you take activates your sense of smell. Your brain processes and identifies smells using a complex network of olfactory receptors, integrating it with information received through the other senses. The processing of sensory information involves two key regions of the brain: the hippocampus and the amygdala, both of which are related to learning and memory.
