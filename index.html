						The term olfaction refers to the human sense of smell. Like many bodily functions, olfaction occurs involuntarily most of the time. Though you may not realize it consciously, every breath you take activates your sense of smell. Your brain processes and identifies smells using a complex network of olfactory receptors, integrating it with information received through the other senses. The processing of sensory information involves two key regions of the brain: the hippocampus and the amygdala, both of which are related to learning and memory.
